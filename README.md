# Digital Clock

This Python script creates a digital clock using the Tkinter library.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter library

## Usage
1. Run the script.
2. The digital clock GUI will open.
3. The clock displays the current time in hours, minutes, and seconds, along with the AM/PM indicator.
4. The time is updated every 200 milliseconds.
5. The clock window is not resizable.
6. Close the clock window to exit the program.

## Note
- The script uses the `time` module to retrieve the current time.
- The clock window is styled with a dark background and light text.
- The clock window title is set to "Digital Clock - JAVATPOINT" and an icon is added.
- The clock GUI consists of a header label and labels for hours, minutes, seconds, and AM/PM indicator.
- The clock labels are arranged in a grid layout using the `grid` method.
- The clock labels have custom font styles and colors.
- The script uses the `after` method to update the clock time periodically.
